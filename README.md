# ECE461_Team17_Phase1
Phase 1 code for the CLI package registry


For the first commit, I added a requirements text file and a gitignore. I also created a folder (/app) where I think we should keep all of our source code and a folder (.github/workflows) which we'll use later to set up the CI/CD pipeline. 
In the root dir, it'll be beneficial to leave global stuff like environment variables and git stuff, then we can put all our app code into the app folder.
It may even behoove us to have separate folders within /app to separate our code since that would almost guarantee we'd never have merge conflicts.
